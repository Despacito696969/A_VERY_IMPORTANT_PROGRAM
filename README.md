I used this funny repo https://github.com/dwyl/english-words for words.txt file.

I wrote it in like an hour, instead of learning for my exam.

Now I can find words that contain a word like: "meow", "nya" or are very close to those words.

Compile this with `odin build .` or `odin build . -o:speed` if you a fast kitteh.
